# Archon
<sup>/ˈɑːr.kɒn/ -> “AR-kon”, "Ark-on", "Ar-chon"</sup>
> [!WARNING]
> This is still under development, use any source code at your own risk.

During my time as an admin for a few Discord servers, and as a perfectionist, I always had the problem of not having enough customization, control, and/or configuration when trying to use a bot for the servers needs. And, even if I did, it would usually be behind a pay wall or the feature was limited to only a few uses/implementations.

I plan to make Archon a kind of *"power-tool"* with multitudes of configuration for all modules, no limits.

It's up to the user to configure and maintain it. Each module will be disabled by default, no bloat, no unnecessary defaults. Just a blank slate, everything greyed out for the task of whatever configuration you have desired.

I do not plan on making any "fun" commands/games. The main idea for this bot is raw utility. Although, this might change, who knows.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Website
  - [ ] Domain name
  - [ ] Dashboard
  - [ ] Visual customization/themes
- [ ] Advanced, user-friendly, and intuitive custom reaction roles</br>
  Inspiration from Tech's [Reaction Roles](https://reactionroles.mtdv.me/) bot.
- [ ] Leveling
- [ ] Starboard
- [ ] Custom user set embeds</br>
Inspiration from the Discohook Team's [Discohook Utils](https://discohook.app).

Much, much more...
## Archon's Philosophy
Archon's philosophy gravitates alongside that of what the name is relative to - Arch Linux, not just the literal meaning of the word.

And, much like Arch, Archon empowers users through responsibility, offers flexibility with its modular design, as configurable as Arch, and independently maintainable. At the same time, handing out transparency and user control with this GitHub repository, clear documentation (yet to be written), and encouraged manual configuration.

Anyway, about the literal meaning of the word. Archon comes from ancient Greek, meaning “ruler” or “magistrate”. In Classical Athens, an archon was a high-ranking official who had administrative, judicial, and sometimes military authority. The term literally conveys leadership, control, and authority.
